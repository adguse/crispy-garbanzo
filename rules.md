# X-Team 004 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will assign tasks based on who feels the strongest for that specific tasks. If one member is having trouble other members will provide support to that person.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will communicate progress through texting. We can view our team's progress on GitHub. When we recieve an assignment we will divide the work accordingly and check on specific dates before the due date that we are all on track to complete each of our pieces of the assignment.(i.e ensure the members of the group aren't leaving their piece of the project to the last minute)

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Difficulties will be communicated in meetings that proceed important deadlines 
as well as through direct messages through email and sms (the contact information 
for which has already been shared amongst us). We also plan to do certain tasks in person together as a group so that  we can ask eachother for help and communicate effectively in person what our confusions are.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

- We will message eachother in our group chat to make sure that everyone has done the work that they were supposed to do before the deadline.
- For some tasks, we will meet up in person and complete tasks that are due together and before we leave we will make sure everything is complete.
- We will be sure to remind eachother of upcoming due dates thorough our group chat.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Be Cheerful. Communication is key! We will be sure to try and make sure everyone has a solid understanding of their roles and responsibilities. If anyone has any questions or is struggling to understand something, as a group we will work to help each other understand. We will be sure divide work evenly and try to answer questions effectively to make our group work well as a team!
