# X-Team 004 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks

We will assign tasks based on who feels the strongest for that specific tasks. If one member is having trouble other members will provide support.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will communicate progress through texting. We can view our team's cueernt progress on GitHub.

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Difficulties will be communicated in meetings that proceed important deadlines 
as well as through direct messages through email and sms (the contact information 
for which has already been shared amongst us). 


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

- We will message eachother in our group chat to make sure that everyone has done the work that they were supposed to do before the deadline.
- For some tasks, we will meet up in person and complete tasks that are due together and before we leave we will make sure everything is complete.
- We will be sure to remind eachother of upcoming due dates thorough our group chat.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together

Be Cheerful.
Communication is key!
